\usage{
  rosBoxPlot(data, site = "", qwcols = c("R", "P"), ...)
}
\arguments{
  \item{data}{is the dataset with columns that begin with P
  followed by a number indicating concentration data and
  columns that begin with R followed by numbers that match
  those of the concentration data indicating qualification
  codes.  See example data sets for more information about
  the data format, \link{IllRivValleyCty} and
  \link{qwMoRivOmaha}.}

  \item{qwcols}{is a character vector with the beginning of
  the column headers for remarks code (default is R), and
  beginning of column headers for concentration data
  (default is P for parameter).}

  \item{site}{is a label for the plot title indicating the
  site where the water-quality samples were collected.}

  \item{...}{arguments to be passed to \link{plot} method.}

\value{
  a boxplot

\description{
  Function to create boxplots of water-quality data that
  include censored values.
}
\details{
  This function determines the columns within the data set
  that have concentration data, based on them having column
  headings that start with P (or a user-specificed
  indicater in the second element of the qwcols argument)
  followed by a number.  The function determines the
  associated remark, or qualification columns, based on
  them having column headings that start with R (or a
  user-specificed indicater in the first element of the
  qwcols argument) followed by numbers that match the
  associated concentration data. Then it determines which
  values are censored, indicated by a less than symbol in
  the R columns, performs regression on order statistics,
  \link{ros}, using the NADA package, and estimates values
  for the censored concentrations for constituents with
  less than 90-percent censoring.  The water-quality
  concentrations are then depicted by boxplots.
}
\note{
  The regression on order statistics function in R package
  NADA (Lee, 2012), \code{\link{ros}}, is an implementation
  of a regression on order statistics designed for
  multiply-censored analytical-chemistry data (Helsel,
  2005).  The method assumes data contains zero to many
  left-censored (less-than) values.  For highly censored
  data, \link{ros} may produce a warning message. Such as,
  \preformatted{Warning messages: 1: In ros(my.list$obs,
  my.list$cen) : Input > 80\% censored -- Results are
  tenuous.} The boxplot will still be generated, but the
  user should consider the warning message when
  interpreting the plots. See Oblinger Childress and others
  (1999) for information on the remark codes used by the
  U.S. Geological Survey.
