}
\arguments{
\item{cdat}{is the concentration data}

\item{cavdat}{is the continuous (daily) ancillary data}

\item{tanm}{is a character identifier that names the trend 
analysis run.  It is used to label output files.}

\item{pnames}{are the parameters (water-quality constituents) to 
analyze (omit the the starting character, for example for sulfate data 
indicated by P00945, enter "00945").}

\item{yrstart}{is the starting year of the analysis (treated as January
1 of that year). Zero means the start date will be determined by the 
start date of cavdat, the continuous ancillary data.}

\item{yrend}{is the ending year of the analysis (treated as December 31
of that year). Zero means the end date will be determined by the end 
date of cavdat, the continuous ancillary data.}

\item{tndbeg}{is the beginning (in whole or decimal years) of the 
trend period. Zero means the begin date will be the beginning of the
concentration data, cdat.}

\item{tndend}{is the end of the trend (treated as December 31
of that year). Zero means the end date will be the end of the 
concentration data, cdat.}

\item{iwcav}{is a character vector indicating which continuous
ancillary variables to include, if none are used for analysis,
use iwcav=c("none").}

\item{dcol}{is the column name for the dates, should be the same for 
both cdat and cavdat}

\item{qwcols}{is a character vector with the beginning of the
column headers for remarks code (default is R), and beginning of 
column headers for concentration data (default is P for parameter).}

\item{mclass}{indicates the class of model to use.
A class 1 model is the the traditional SEAWAVE-Q model that has a
linear time trend. A class 2 model is a newer option for longer
trend periods that uses a set of restricted cubic splines on the 
time variable to provide a more flexible model.}

\item{numk}{is the number of knots in the restricted cubic spline model.
The default is 4, and the recommended number is 3--7.}

\item{alpha}{is the significance level or alpha values for statistical
significance and confidence intervals}

\item{bootRCS}{is a logical value indicating whether or not to perform
block bootstrapping for an attained significance level for the trend
with restricted cubic splines. No bootstrapping is performed for the linear
trend model.}

\item{nboot}{is the number of bootstrap replicates. A large number, 10,000,
is recommended, but this takes a long time.}

\value{
a pdf file containing plots of the data and modeled 
concentration, a text file containing a summary of the survival 
regression call for each model selected, and a list. The first element
of the list is a data frame described under format. The second element
of the list is the summary of the survival regression call. The third 
element is the observed concentration data (censored and uncensored). 
The fourth element is the concentration data predicted by the model.  
The fifth element provides summary statistics for the predicted 
concentrations. The sixth element is a data frame that provides a summary of 
the trends with the columns pname (parameter name), mclass (a value of 1, 
indicating a linear trend model, a value of 2 for models using restricted
cubic splines), and the columns describing the trends. For linear models  
see \code{\link{pesticideTrendCalcs}}. For models with restricted cubic
splines, see the format section. See Ryberg and York (2020) for additional
details.

\description{
Function to prepare data and fit the seawaveQ model.
}
\details{
Fits the seawaveQ model (Vecchia and others, 2008) using a seasonal 
wave and continuous ancillary variables (streamflow anomalies and other 
continuous variables such as conductivity or sediment) to model water 
quality. The version in the 2.0.0 update to the R package has an
option to use restricted cubic splines as a more flexible definition
of the temporal trend.
}
\note{
The assumed data format is one with columns for water-quality
concentration values and a related column for qualification of 
those values, such as in the case of left-censored values less 
than a particular value. For example, a water-quality sample
was collected and the laboratory analysis indicated that the 
concentration was less than 0.01 micrograms per liter. The 
USGS parameter code for simazine is 04035 (U.S. Geological Survey, 
2013b). When the data are retrieved through the National Water 
Information System: Web Interface 
(\url{https://waterdata.usgs.gov/nwis}; U.S. Geological Survey, 2013a), 
the concentration values are in a column labeled P04035 and the 
qualification information, or remark codes, are in a column labeled 
R04035. To use this function, the argument pnames would be the unique 
identifier for simazine values and qualifications, 04035, and the 
qwcols argument would be c("R", "P") to indicate that the 
qualification column starts with an R and the values column starts with 
a P. \cr
Other users may have data in different formats that can be 
modified to use with this function. For example, a user may have
concentration values and qualification codes in one column, such
as a column labeled simazine with the values 0.05, 0.10, <0.01, 
<0.01, and 0.90. In this case, the less thans and any other 
qualification codes should be placed in a separate column. The
column names for the qualification codes and the concentration values
should be the same with the exception of different beginning
letters to indicate which column is which. The columns could be
named Rsimazine and Psimazine. Then the argument pnames = "simazine" 
and the argument qwcols = c("R", "P"). \cr

Users should exercise caution when their water-quality data have 
multiple censoring limits and may want to recensor the data to a 
single censoring level. Censoring and recensoring issues are discussed
in the text and Appendix 1 of Ryberg and others (2010).

None of the variations of SEAWAVE is a simple model. The model complexity 
increases with flow anomalies and with the addition of restricted cubic 
splines. As the number of parameters in the model increases or the degree
of censoring increases, the sample size must also increase. See Ryberg 
and others (2020) for more details on sample size.
