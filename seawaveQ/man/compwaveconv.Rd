\title{Seasonal Wave Computation}
\usage{
compwaveconv(cmaxt, jmod, hlife)
}
\arguments{
\item{cmaxt}{The decimal time in years of the maximum chemical concentration.}

\item{jmod}{The choice of model or pulse input function, an integer 1 through 14.}

\item{hlife}{The model half-life in months, 1 to 4 months.}
}
\value{
A numeric vector of size 361 with discrete values of the 
seasonal wave for decimal season \code{seq(0,1,1/360)}.
}
\description{
Function to compute seasonal wave.
}
\note{
The seasonal wave is a dimensionless, periodic function of time 
with an annual cycle, similar to a mixture of sine and cosine functions 
often used to model seasonality in concentration data. However, the 
seasonal wave is better suited for modeling seasonal behavior of 
pesticide data than a mixture of sines and cosines. The pulse input 
function, represented by jmod, has either one or two distinct 
application seasons (when pesticides may be transported to the stream) 
of lengths from 1 to 6 months. Therefore, 56 (14x4) choices for the 
wave function are available.
The numeric vector is a discrete approximation of the continuous wave 
function defined on the interval 0 to 1.

\examples{
# Evaluate seasonal wave for specified decimal seasons
# These example decimal dates represent days at points 0.25, 0.5, and 
# 0.75 percent of the way through the year and the end of the year
dseas <- c(0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1)
swave <- compwaveconv(cmaxt = 0.483, jmod = 2, hlife = 4)
swave[floor(360 * dseas)]
plot(seq(0, 1, 1/360), swave, typ = "l")
