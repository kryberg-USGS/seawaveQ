\title{Boxplot of water-quality data}
\usage{
rosBoxPlot(data, site = "", qwcols = c("R", "P"), ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{The dataset with columns that begin with P
followed by a number indicating concentration data and 
columns that begin with R followed by numbers that match those
of the concentration data indicating qualification codes. See 
example data sets for more information about the data format, 
\link{IllRivValleyCty} and \link{qwMoRivOmaha}.}

\item{site}{A label for the plot title indicating the site where
the water-quality samples were collected.}

\item{qwcols}{A character vector with the beginning of the
column headers for remarks code (default is R), and beginning of 
column headers for concentration data (default is P for parameter).}

\item{...}{Arguments to be passed to \link{plot} method.}
}
\value{
A boxplot
}
\description{
Function to create boxplots of water-quality data that include
censored values.
}
\details{
This function determines the columns within the data set that have
concentration data, based on them having column headings that start
with P (or a user-specificed indicater in the second element of the 
qwcols argument) followed by a number. The function determines the 
associated remark, or qualification columns, based on them having 
column headings that start with R (or a user-specificed indicator in 
the first element of the qwcols argument) followed by numbers that 
match the associated concentration data. Then it determines which 
values are censored, indicated by a less than symbol in the R columns, 
performs regression on order statistics, \link{ros}, using the NADA 
package, and estimates values for the censored concentrations for 
constituents with less than 90-percent censoring. The water-quality 
concentrations are then depicted by boxplots.
}
\note{
The regression on order statistics function in R package NADA 
(Lee, 2012), \code{\link{ros}}, is an implementation of a regression on 
order statistics designed for multiply-censored analytical-chemistry 
data (Helsel, 2005). The method assumes data contains zero to many 
left-censored (less-than) values. For highly censored data, \link{ros} 
may produce a warning message. Such as, 
\preformatted{Warning messages:
1: In ros(my.list$obs, my.list$cen) :
 Input > 80\% censored -- Results are tenuous.}
The boxplot will still be generated, but the user should consider the
warning message when interpreting the plots.
See Oblinger Childress and others (1999) for information on the 
remark codes used by the U.S. Geological Survey.
