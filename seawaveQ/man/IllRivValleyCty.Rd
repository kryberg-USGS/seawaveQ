\details{
  Chemical concentration data are in the columns that start with a P and are 
  followed by a number.  Qualification codes for the concentration data are in 
  the columns that start with an R followed by the same numbers as the 
  associated concentration data.  For example, column P04035 indicates simazine 
  data, 04035, being the U.S. Geological Survey parameter code for simazine.
  The qualification codes for the simazine concentrations are found in 
  the column R04035, indicating a U.S. Geological Survey remark code.
  Remark codes include _ or nothing, indicating no qualification of the 
  value in the associated concentration field; <, indicating a censored
  value that is less than the number reported in the associated 
  concentration field; and E, indicating that the value has been estimated.
  See Oblinger Childress and others (1999) for information on the remark codes 
  used by the U.S. Geological Survey.
  The streamflow and sediment anomalies were generated using the R package 
  waterData (Ryberg and Vecchia, 2012).
