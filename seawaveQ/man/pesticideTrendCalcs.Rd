\usage{
pesticideTrendCalcs(tndbeg, tndend, ctnd, pval, alpha, setnd, scl, baseConc,
  mclass)
}
\arguments{
\item{tndbeg}{is the beginning (in whole or decimal years) of the 
trend period. Zero means the begin date will be the beginning of the
concentration data, cdat.}

\item{tndend}{is the end of the trend (treated as December 31
of that year). Zero means the end date will be the end of the 
concentration data, cdat.}

\item{ctnd}{is the concentration trend, the coefficient on the time variable.}

\item{pval}{is the p-value for the linear trend component.}

\item{alpha}{is the significance level or alpha value for statistical
significance and confidence intervals.}

\item{setnd}{is the standard error for the linear trend component.}

\item{scl}{is the scale factor from the \code{survreg.object}.}

\item{baseConc}{is the base concentration, the median concentration 
(midpoint of the trend line) for the first year of the trend analysis .}

\item{mclass}{indicates the class of model to use.
A class 1 model is the the traditional SEAWAVE-Q model that has a
linear time trend. A class 2 model is a newer option for longer
trend periods that uses a set of restricted cubic splines on the 
time variable to provide a more flexible model.}
}
\value{
The data frame returned has one row for each chemical analyzed and
summaries of the trend.

\description{
Internal function to summarize the trend results.

\note{
Based on trend calculations used to display and summarize pesticide
trends here \url{https://nawqatrends.wim.usgs.gov/swtrends/}.
A likelihood value that is the functional equivalent of the two-sided 
p-value associated with the significance level of the trend was 
determined as follows:
Likelihood = (1 - (p-value / 2)), where p-value is the 
p-value for the trend coefficient (Oelsner and others, 2017).
