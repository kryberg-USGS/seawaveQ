#' Function to calculate pesticide loads in kilograms per year.
#' 
#' Parameter load (mass) is the product of water-quality concentration 
#' (a mass per volume)and an associated streamflow rate (volume per time). This
#' function generates an annual time series of pesticide loads on either a
#' calendar year basis or a water year basis.
#' @name loadCalculations
#' @title Fit seasonal wave and continuous ancillary data for trend 
#' analysis
#' @note In this load calculation function, daily pesticide concentration 
#' estimates provided by the \code{fitswavecav} function are corrected for 
#' retransformation bias (the concentration model is built on #' the base-10 
#' logarithm of concentration; therefore, a bias correction is required when 
#' transforming back to the original units) and then used to calculate daily 
#' loads. The bias correction is based on the quasi-maximum likelihood estimator 
#' (Cohn and others, 1989) that was developed for natural logarithms, with an 
#' adjustment for the base-10 logarithm of the concentration. To calculate 
#' loads, the bias-corrected concentration estimates are multiplied by daily 
#' streamflow and a constant, 0.892998605, which converts the load units 
#' (micrograms per liter * cubic feet per second) to kilograms per year. 
#' Daily loads are summed to annual values. See page 70 and equation 26 of 
#' Oelsner and others (2017) for further details regarding the load 
#' calculation and bias correction.
#' Users may modify this function to convert to units other than kilograms
#' per year.
#' @param dailyDat is the daily streamflow data in the form of a data.frame
#' with three columns representing a station ID, date, and streamflow
#' @param pestPredict is the continuous (daily) estimation of pesticide
#' concentrations for one or more pesticides at a single site. This should be
#' in the form of the fourth element of the list returned by \code{fitswavecav}.
#' @param modRes is the first element of the list returned by \code{fitswavecav} 
#' and include the scale parameter for one or more pesticide trend models at
#' a single site. The scale parameter is used in the bias correction.
#' @param yrtype allows one to calculate annual loads based on a calendar 
#' year or a water year, where a water year is the 12-month period October 1 
#' through September 30 designated by the calendar year in which it ends. A 
#' yrtype of 1 represents a calendar year and is the default because that
#' is the way the original model was developed. A yrtype of 2 represents a
#' water year. 
#' @keywords datagen ts
#' @return a data frame.
#' @format The data frame returned has one row for each pesticide-year at
#' a particular site and four columns. The general format is as follows: \cr
#' \tabular{lll}{
#'  pstaid \tab character \tab The station identification number \cr
#'  pcode \tab character \tab The parameter code for which a load was calculated\cr
#'  year or wyear \tab numeric \tab The year or water year for which a load was calculated \cr
#'  load \tab numeric \tab the load in kilograms per year \cr
