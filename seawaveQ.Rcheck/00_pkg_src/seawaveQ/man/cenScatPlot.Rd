\usage{
cenScatPlot(data, datescol = "dates", pname, qwcols = c("R", "P"),
  site = "", xlabel = "", ylabel = "Concentration", legpos = "topright",
  legcex = 1, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{is the dataset with columns that begin with P followed 
by alphanumeric characters indicating concentration data and columns 
that begin with R followed by alphanumeric characters that match those 
of the concentration data indicating qualification codes.  See example 
datasets for more information about the data format, see 
\code{\link{IllRivValleyCty}} and \code{\link{qwMoRivOmaha}}.}

\item{datescol}{is the column label for the dates column.}

\item{pname}{is the the column heading (paramenter name) for the 
particular water-quality constituent to be plotted (omit 
the the starting character, for example for sulfate data indicated by 
P00945, enter "00945").}

\item{qwcols}{is a character vector with the beginning of the
column headers for remarks code (default is R), and beginning of 
column headers for concentration data (default is P for parameter).}

\item{site}{is a label for the plot title indicating the site where
the water-quality samples were collected.}

\item{xlabel}{is the label for the x-axis, defaults to no label.}

\item{ylabel}{is the label for the y-axis.}

\item{legpos}{is the position of the legend, see \link{legend}.}

\item{legcex}{is a numerical value giving the amount by which the 
legend text and symbols should be magnified relative to the default, 
1.}

\item{...}{arguments to be passed to \link{plot} method.}

\description{
Function to generate a scatter plot that indicates censored and 
estimated water-quality concentrations.
}
\details{
This function uses the qualification, or remark, column associated
with water-quality concentration values to indicate which samples are 
unqualified, which are estimated, and which are censored.
A blank remark field or an "_" indicates that the concentration 
value is not qualified; an "E" indicates the values has been 
estimated; and a less than symbol, "<", indicates the value has been 
censored as less than a minimum reporting level.  See Oblinger 
Childress (1999) for information on the minimum reporting level and 
the definition of "E" for U.S. Geological Survey data.  Other users may 
have a different definition of the minimum reporting level, but 
censored values need to be qualified with a "<".  Using the "E" code is 
optional.
